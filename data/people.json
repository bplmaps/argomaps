            "description": "<p>William Faden was an accomplished engraver and publisher who produced over a hundred maps in his lifetime, including official maps for the British Parliament as well as maps made for mass consumption and decorative purposes. Faden is best known for his time as Cartographer to the King. His <em>North America Atlas<\/em> (1777) also brought Faden considerable fame and was widely used by both the American and British armies during the American Revolutionary War.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vn23b\"><img alt=\"Detail from William Faden's 1776 map &quot;The Attack and defeat of the American fleet under Benedict Arnold&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vn24m\/1765,384,10264,7004\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:546px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willam Faden was born in 1749 to the English publisher William MackFaden. At age 15, Faden began apprenticing as an engraver. As an adult, he worked with acclaimed engraver Thomas Jefferys, who also served as the Cartographer to the King, until Jefferys&rsquo;s death in 1771. Two years later, the Jefferys family engraving, publishing, and map selling business changed its name to &ldquo;Jeffreys and Faden,&rdquo; reflecting Faden&#39;s importance to the business and his increased status within the cartography industry. The period between 1773 and 1778 was particularly busy for Faden, as the American Revolutionary War created a large demand for maps of North America, from both the American and British armies. In response to this demand, Faden engraved and published roughly twenty maps with military plans, complete with troop movements and other fine details. One notable and comprehensive map Faden created showed the capture and destruction of American ships under the command of Benedict Arnold in the <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vn23b\">Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in October 1776<\/a>. The map identifies the types of ships, their names, and their captains, as well as how, and to what extent, the ships are armed. In 1777, Faden published his most important work, <em>North American Atlas<\/em>. The volume is widely considered one of the most important cartographic works of the Revolutionary War and includes twenty-nine maps by some of the most distinguished cartographers of the day, including Faden. Faden&rsquo;s other high-quality engravings, such as his <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vq18w\">map of New Jersey<\/a>&mdash;which displays such clarity and precision that it was considered one of the best maps of the region for at least a decade&mdash;further solidified his reputation as a meticulous and talented professional. Faden&rsquo;s reputation for excellent work ultimately caught the eye of George III, leading to his appointment as the Cartographer to the King in 1783. In the position, Faden produced maps for the full British government, including Parliament.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vq18w\"><img alt=\"William Faden's 1778 map &quot;The Province of New Jersey&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vq195\/32,67,3382,4540\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:671px; margin:5px 20px; width:500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faden also conducted business with Americans. In 1786, Thomas Jefferson set out to make an accurate and updated map of Virginia. However, in order to accomplish this, he needed to acquire various maps of the state to study and compile. Jefferson purchased almost all of the maps he used for his project from Faden&rsquo;s shop in London, referring to him as &ldquo;The principal map seller in London.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> Jefferson also wanted Faden to engrave and publish his new map of Virginia, but Faden found the American&rsquo;s offer too low. Instead, the job of engraving and publishing went to another well-known individual in the cartography world, Robert Sayer.&nbsp;In 1786, Jefferson also inquired if Faden knew anything about an elusive map of South America. The Spanish Government had destroyed the plates and forbid the map from being printed due to a potential boundary dispute with Portugal. Jefferson had one of the remaining copies and offered to send it to Faden for engraving and publishing if Faden sent back &ldquo;a half a dozen copies for Congress, for its bureaus, and for myself.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a> Jefferson was specific that he wanted Faden to engrave and publish the map. He wrote to the American legation, William Smith, who was serving in London, &ldquo;I will pray you to take arrangements with Faden . . . He is the best. For his gain he will wish to make the map large.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a> Despite Jefferson&rsquo;s inquiry, Faden never engraved nor published this map. Rather than money, his refusal this time was most likely due to his position as Cartographer to the King and desire to avoid an international dispute with the Spanish government.<a href=\"#\">[4]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>William Faden&rsquo;s reputation for quality work went beyond cartographers and map enthusiasts. In 1796, he was awarded a gold medal from the Royal Society of the Arts for his work overseeing and publishing a topographical map of Sussex. Faden continued to work as the Cartographer to the King and run his own business, with great financial and personal success, until 1823 when he retired. He died in 1836 and left behind a considerable fortune.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Samuel Johannes Holland was a Dutch-born mapmaker who played a significant role in aiding the British war efforts in North America during the Seven Years&rsquo; War and beyond. An invaluable asset to the British throughout his career, Holland became the first British Surveyor General of North America.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holland was born in 1728 in Nijmegen, Netherlands. The young&nbsp;Holland had joined the Dutch artillery forces as a cadet and saw action during the War of the Austrian Succession.&nbsp;With the war over by 1748, Lieutenant-Colonel Holland proved himself as a superb artillery officer and began to develop as a leading mapmaker.&nbsp;Holland acquired essential cartography skills during his wartime experience, eventually leading to the authorship of his first maps of Nijmegen in 1752 and Hertogenbosch in 1755. However, for a talented young officer like Holland, the Dutch military did not provide ample opportunities for further advancement. Instead, he accepted an offer from Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, to become a British lieutenant in the fourth battalion of the Royal American Regiment. Upon his arrival in New York, Holland served as the regiment&rsquo;s engineer in July 1756. Holland excelled in this new position as his knowledge of geography and mathematics elevated him above other officers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:7h149v43f\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:7h149v44q\/228,303,13832,6622\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:383px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holland&rsquo;s maps helped the British achieve critical victories throughout the Seven Years&rsquo; War. In 1758, British forces under the command of Brigadier General James Wolfe advanced on Louisbourg at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River.&nbsp;Holland, serving as Wolfe&rsquo;s engineer, played a critical role in both creating and implementing a battleplan for the siege.Writing to the Duke of Richmond after the British victory at Louisbourg, Wolfe praised Holland as a &ldquo;brave and active fellow,&rdquo; who could deliver a plan of attack that &ldquo;will amaze you.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> Holland&rsquo;s skills at Louisbourg earned him an invitation to share his knowledge with the captain of&nbsp;HMS Pembroke, John Simcoe, where he caught the attention of&nbsp;Pembroke&rsquo;s&nbsp;master, James Cook.&nbsp; Holland later recounted how he and Cook compiled &ldquo;materials for a chart of the Gulf and River Saint Lawrence,&rdquo; and as the pair departed to prepare for the forthcoming British advance.<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a>&nbsp;The surveys conducted by Holland and Cook were instrumental in aiding the eventual British capture of Quebec in September 1759. After being promoted to captain, Holland was <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:7h149v43f\">initially tasked with devising plans for new forts to be constructed in Quebec<\/a>.&nbsp;Still, more work was needed to map the entirety of the St. Lawrence River region. As such, General James Murray arranged a team of surveyors, including Holland, to map the area.&nbsp;Upon the completion of the task in November 1761, Murray praised Holland as &ldquo;an industrious, brave officer, and an intelligent engineer, in which capacity he would be desirous, and deservedly merits to be advanced.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Armed with his new maps of Canada, Holland returned to Britain. During his time in London, Holland proposed to the Board of Trade to authorize a general survey of the entirety of settleable British North American landholdings.&nbsp;Holland not only received approval from the Board but was also appointed Surveyor General in April of 1764 as he prepared to return to North America.&nbsp;As he was directing such a significant project, the next few years were busy for the new Surveyor-General of North America. Often facing unfavorable weather between 1764 and 1770, Holland and his team fell short of their goal to complete the entire survey of the Northern District, which reached as far south as the Potomac River. Still, Holland was pleased that he acquired&nbsp;&ldquo;<a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:hx11z066j\">materials for forming a general map of our surveys of the gulph and river St. Lawrence<\/a>.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[4<\/a>]&nbsp;Yet, Holland&rsquo;s general survey remained incomplete as conflicts escalated in Britain&rsquo;s American colonies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1770, Holland <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:wd3762772\">moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire<\/a>, where he continued to direct surveys of the British North American territories.<a href=\"#\">[5]<\/a>&nbsp;With revolution forthcoming, Holland returned to Britain in 1775 out of fears that he would be targeted by revolutionaries due to his connections to the crown. During his time in London, Holland provided maps from his general survey of the Northern District to be published in JFW Des Barres&rsquo; <em>The Atlantic Neptune<\/em>.&nbsp;After receiving a military commission, Holland returned to North America in 1776. Holland became head of the elite &ldquo;Guides and Pioneers&rdquo; along with Charles Blaskowitz and George Sproule. This group was assigned the significant task of producing <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:9s161885z\">wartime maps<\/a> for the British.&nbsp;Holland&rsquo;s active combat service ended in October 1778, when Quebec&rsquo;s Governor Frederick Haldimand called upon Holland to resume his surveyal duties. Returning with his family to Quebec, Holland acquired vast amounts of personal landholdings, and was an active participant in the Quebec Legislative Council.&nbsp;However, due to his declining health, Holland was mostly confined to his house overseeing his surveying teams from afar and spending his days completing paperwork.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Growing old and unable to properly fulfill his duties, Holland was forced to step back further. Seeing the elderly Holland, the First Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada John Graves Simcoe remarked, &ldquo;Poor Holland . . . that good and faithful servant of the Crown is worn out in body, tho&rsquo; in full possession of his intellect.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[6]<\/a> Most of Holland&rsquo;s final projects during the 1790s focused on mapping and distributing claims to new townships in Lower Canada. He petitioned for vast amounts of land for himself in the newly established Kingsey Township in Quebec.<a href=\"#\">[7]<\/a> Holland slowly began to delegate his positions to others, and ultimately transferred his duties as Surveyor General to William Vondenvelden&nbsp;in 1801.&nbsp;Shortly after relinquishing his duties, Holland died on December 28, 1801, at Holland House in Quebec.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>John Montresor was also a prolific surveyor and mapmaker, drawing as many as two thousand maps during his career in America. During his twenty-three years in America, Montresor participated in significant battles in the Seven Years&rsquo; War and the American Revolutionary War. His notable works include maps of the New England backcountry, a city plan of New York, and battleground maps in and around Boston and Philadelphia.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Montresor was born on April 6, 1736, at Gibraltar, the firstborn son of Colonel James Gabriel Montresor, an engineer in the British army. Montresor also became an engineer and served four years in Gibraltar under his father before arriving in America in 1754. Montresor&rsquo;s duties as an engineer include constructing and improving fortifications as well as conducting sieges. Montresor was wounded in battle during Major General Edward Braddock&rsquo;s failed campaign against Fort Duquesne (today Pittsburgh) in 1755. He then participated in sieges against French garrisons at Louisbourg in 1758 and Quebec in 1759. In January 1760, Brigadier General James Murray, whom Montresor called &ldquo;a madman&rdquo; in his journal, sought to communicate with Major General Jeffery Amherst regarding the state of the British garrison in Quebec.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> Montresor volunteered for the mission and led a near month-long snowshoe expedition through uncharted New England backcountry, which his party barely survived. Writing to Amherst afterwards, Montresor lamented that his party &ldquo;were 13 days without bread and 11 without meat, owing to the little knowledge we had of the distance we had to go&rdquo; and that the party survived by eating their &ldquo;Indian shoes, bullet pouches and all the spare leather we brought, with berries, buds, bark and boiled mountain tea.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a> In his journal from the trek, Montresor wrote, &ldquo;Gave the Commander in Chief a journal and<a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nj194\"> plan of my route to a scale of 8 miles to an inch<\/a>.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a>&nbsp;Montresor conducted a scouting mission the following year, during which he charted unexplored areas between Canada and Maine and produced a more detailed area map, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524n7511\"><em>A Map of the Sources of the Chaudie\u0300re, Penobscot, and Kennebec Rivers<\/em><\/a>. Montresor&rsquo;s journal and map from the 1761 exploration later fell into the possession of Benedict Arnold, who, as a colonel in the Continental Army, used them to plan a 1775 invasion of Canada with George Washington&rsquo;s full support.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vs082\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vs09b\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:799px; margin:5px 20px; width:663px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the Seven Years&rsquo; War, Montresor led a detachment that relieved British forces at the besieged Fort Detroit during Pontiac&rsquo;s War, a mission Montresor referred to as &ldquo;My great success in 1763.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[4]<\/a>&nbsp; In 1764, he led a force of French Canadians, the first of its kind, throughout the Niagara district and built redoubts to defend against Indian attacks. While in New York in 1765, Montresor witnessed daily civil unrest over the impending Stamp Act. On October 23, he noted in his journal that &ldquo;Many placards put up threatening the lives, houses and properties of any one who shall either issue or receive a stamp.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[5]<\/a> On November 1, he added that &ldquo;the Rabble or rather Rebels assembled again early in the evening &amp; continued the riot till 4 this morning, their numbers about 2000 during which time they broke open the Governor&rsquo;s coach house&rdquo; and attempted to scale the fort walls.<a href=\"#\">[6]<\/a> During this unrest, British Commander-in-Chief Major General Thomas Gage requested Montresor &ldquo;to sketch him a plan of this place on a large scale with its environs and adjacent country together with its harbour.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[7]<\/a> Fearing for his safety, Montresor surveyed the city discreetly. On January 7, 1766, he wrote, &ldquo;continued on my survey Sub Rosa as observations might endanger one&rsquo;s house and effects if not one&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[8]<\/a> The map that Montresor produced&mdash;<a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vs082\"><em>A Plan of the City of New-York &amp; its Environs<\/em><\/a>&mdash;is recognized as among the most accurate, detailed, and artfully executed plans of any American colonial city.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Montresor recorded in his journal that in 1769, he &ldquo;divided the line between the provinces of New York and New Jersey by astronomical observations,&rdquo; which had long been a contentious boundary issue.<a href=\"#\">[9]<\/a> Then, from 1770 to 1773, he recommended and oversaw improvements to Castle William, an island fort in Boston Harbor, and planned and constructed Fort Mifflin, also known as Mud Fort, in Philadelphia. His sketch, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:t722hs667\"><em>A General &amp; Particular Plan of the Island of Castle William near Boston<\/em><\/a>, shows the Boston garrison in detail. He also contributed to <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nk556\">notable surveys of Philadelphia and Fort Mifflin<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524n803k\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524n804v\/83,112,4962,5885\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:841px; margin:5px 20px; width:709px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Montresor was at Lexington when the Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775. He produced many maps and sketches of defensive works during the British defense of Boston, including <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vj26j\"><em>Plan of the Peninsula of Charles Town <\/em><\/a>(1775) and <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vj22f\">[Plan of the &quot;Neck&quot; and fortifications]<\/a> (1775).&nbsp;Having designed many British fortifications in Boston himself, Montresor depicted them in<em> <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vj240\">A Draught of the Towns of Boston and Charles Town and the Circumjacent Country<\/a><\/em>, which contributed to other notable maps of Boston at the time.&nbsp;He was appointed Chief Engineer of America in December 1775. When the British evacuated Boston in March 1776, Montresor was ordered to blow up Castle William to prevent its use by the enemy, which he &ldquo;effected without one failing&rdquo; by using eighty-seven mines.<a href=\"#\">[10]<\/a> Later, as part of General William Howe&rsquo;s 1777 Philadelphia campaign, Montresor produced a campaign map&mdash;<a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524n803k\"><em>Operations of the British army, from the 25th August to 26th Sept. 1777<\/em><\/a>&mdash;reflecting his meticulous journal entries leading to the British occupation of Philadelphia and various battle maps for <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd733\">Brandywine <\/a>and <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nb650\">Germantown<\/a>.<a href=\"#\">[11]<\/a>&nbsp;Having planned and built Fort Mifflin, Montresor led the siege against it before it was evacuated on November 15, 1777. Montresor resigned his commission and returned to England in 1778 due to poor health and a poor relationship with General Sir Henry Clinton. He left with a taint of bitterness towards higher authorities regarding lack of recognition for his contributions specifically, and those of engineers generally, during their service in America. Montresor faced legal troubles following an unfavorable audit of his accounts related to the Engineering Department in America. The British government reportedly seized and sold his estate in Kent to recoup monies owed, but it is unclear if that occurred before or after Montresor&rsquo;s death in Maidstone, Kent in June 1799.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Claude Joseph Sauthier was a surveyor in the British Army during the American Revolution. He was born on November 10, 1736, in Strasbourg, on the Franco-German border, to Joseph Philippe, a saddler, and Barbe Primat Sauthier. Early in his life, Sauthier took an interest in surveying and draftsmanship. By the time he was twenty-three years old, Sauthier had completed one of the most impressive surveys of Alsace, assisted by Cassini De Thury, a French intellectual who revolutionized mapmaking in the region with his innovation of triangulation. In the mid-1760s, Sauthier arrived in North Carolina on a royal commission from the British Crown to survey and map the colony, where he worked under the eighth royal governor of Virginia, Lord William Tryon. During his tenure in the North Carolina colony, Sauthier completed twelve detailed maps of different localities.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:hx11z441h\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:hx11z442s\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:649px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most famous of these maps was the 1769 map of New Bern, which served as the seat of the royal government in North Carolina. This map, entitled <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:hx11z441h\"><em>A Plan of the Town of New Bern in Craven County North Carolina<\/em><\/a>, depicts a detailed view of the colonial capital, complete with labeled roads, natural features, and the governor&rsquo;s palace at the southern center, above the banks of the Trent River. The cartouche lists the important landmarks and their corresponding letters, including the wharfs (G) in the east and south, a church (A) in between Tryon Palace (B) and the eastern wharves (G), and the &ldquo;Tann Yard&rdquo; (E) just west of the Neuse River. The most prominent detail in the map is Tryon Palace, the royal governor&rsquo;s private residence, which was completed with a prominent &ldquo;Flag Staff&rdquo; and featured a garden in the northern part of the property bisected by a walkway or a wall.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the spring of 1770, Sauthier had completed several other maps and surveys of North Carolina towns, including Hillsborough, Bath, Brunswick, and Edenton. Sauthier&rsquo;s work was recognized in a 1771 letter to the North Carolina House of Assembly, where Tryon praised Sauthier&rsquo;s recent survey of the Granville District as being &ldquo;attended [to] with much Fatigue and Expence of Travelling, as well as a considerable length of Time in performing those Services.&rdquo; Tryon, impressed with &ldquo;the Ingenuity of the Gentleman,&rdquo; was pleased to &ldquo;recommend Him [Sauthier] to Your [the assembly&rsquo;s] Liberality.&rdquo; Lord Tryon was so pleased with Sauthier&rsquo;s work that, when he was appointed Governor of New York later that year, he brought Sauthier with him.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In New York, Sauthier became a prominent surveyor for Lord Governor Tryon, conducting several surveys of the colony and New York City. The best known of these was his <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vs634\">1776 map of the New York province<\/a>. The topographical survey depicted the administrative boundaries of New York in relation to the Long Island Sound, New Jersey, Quebec, and the land holdings of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. The map was published by <a href=\"\/people\/william-faden\">William Faden<\/a> in his <em>North American Atlas<\/em> (1777).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524n8738\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524n874j\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:799px; margin:5px 20px; width:433px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the War for Independence spread across North America, Sauthier&rsquo;s royal benefactors called upon him to join the British war effort against the continental rebellion. With his history of publishing detailed maps, Sauthier became one of the most important mapmakers in the Americas. In the early years of the war, Sauthier found himself in the employ of Earl Percy, an officer under the command of British General William Howe. While General Howe and Lord Percy fought the campaign in New York, Sauthier chronicled the feats and strategy of the British troops. In September 1776, Howe captured Manhattan from General George Washington&rsquo;s troops, who retreated from the city. Sauthier&nbsp;illustrated this event in a map entitled <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524n800r\"><em>A Plan of The Operations of The King&#39;s Army under the Command of General Sir William Howe, K.B. In New York And East New Jersey, against the American Forces Commanded by General Washington<\/em><\/a>. The detailed map includes the forts, embrasures, and ramparts that Washington used to defend the city; also depicted was the damage caused by the large fire of September 21. Map scholar William Cumming considers it &ldquo;the most important example of the maps developed from the Ratzer Plan&rdquo; &mdash; the standard portrayal of New York in the 1770s.<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sauthier worked alongside Earl Percy for the rest of the general&rsquo;s service in the war. On November 16, 1776, when the British under Percy attacked Fort Washington, it was Sauthier who surveyed the field and constructed the <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524n8738\">battle map of the Continental fortification on the Hudson River<\/a>. Scholars contend that William Faden&rsquo;s engraving of the map was one of the most accurate and beautiful maps of northern New York Island. Later in 1776, Sauthier accompanied Percy to Newport, Rhode Island, where British General Henry Clinton had captured the key maritime post. These early days of occupation were&nbsp;captured in Sauthier&rsquo;s <em>Plan of the Town of New Port with its Environs, Survey&rsquo;d by the Order of His Excellency the Right Honourable Earl Percy Lieutenant General Commanding his Majesty&rsquo;s Forces on Rhode Island<\/em> (1777). The map features detailed illustration of the harbor that was utilized by the British, old homes, and plots of farmland.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Percy soon fell out of favor with General Howe in 1777 over a command dispute. He left North America in May 1777, bringing Sauthier with him as a personal secretary. In this capacity, Sauthier crafted numerous estate maps for Percy after the latter ascended to the dukedom of Northumberland. Sauthier eventually returned to France, where he died in 1802 at the age of sixty-six.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Mary Ann Rocque, ne&eacute; Scal&eacute;, was one&nbsp;of the few prominent female cartographers of the eighteenth century. Born in 1725 in England, Rocque began her mapping career after taking over the publishing company of her deceased husband, the legendary cartographer John Rocque. She is remembered for her significant contributions to the early mapping of North American forts and Canadian towns, as well as for her pioneering map of Albany, New York.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a brief marriage to the apothecary Edward Bew, Mary Anne married John Rocque in 1751. One of the most celebrated mapmakers in eighteenth-century England, Rocque was particularly known for his work as the official topographer to His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester. John Rocque trained Mary Ann and her younger brother, Peter Bernard Scal&eacute; (born in 1738), who went on to become a successful cartographer in Ireland. Both Mary Ann and John Rocque were Huguenots.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"\/content\/mrocque-1.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:608px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While long surrounded by accomplished mapmakers, Mary Ann Rocque fully embraced the craft upon the death of John Rocque in 1762. Records indicate that she began to run his company on January 27, 1762, per the request of his will. Instead of selling his business and living a life of leisure, Rocque seemed to relish her newly inherited enterprise. She quickly embarked on publishing maps that her late husband had produced before his death, including <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vr80k\"><em>A General Map of North America<\/em><\/a> as well as her own original works. In 1763, she published a new edition of John&rsquo;s <em>The Environs of London, Reduced from an Actual Survey in 16 Sheets<\/em>.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> The same year, she also published his <em>Traveller&rsquo;s Assistant<\/em>, the first British road book to include Scotland and Ireland, which also featured illustrations by famed English engraver Thomas Kitchin.<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a> Rocque published this work along with Andrew Dury, a successful cartographer, colleague, and friend of her deceased husband. Together, they also published multiple other works, including John Rocque&rsquo;s <em>A General Map of North America<\/em>. In 1765, only two years after taking over the business, Rocque produced her own consequential atlas, <em>A Set of Plans and Forts in America, Reduced from Actual Surveys<\/em>&nbsp;detailing thirty forts and other significant locations from the Seven Years&rsquo; War as well as the <em>Plan of Fort Frederick, At Albany<\/em> (1763) which served as one of Albany&rsquo;s first maps. Rocque published numerous additional pieces, both her own work and that of the deceased John Rocque, until her retirement in 1770. It is unknown how soon after she passed; she left no heirs.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>John Graves Simcoe (1752-1806) was a British cartographer, soldier, and lieutenant governor of Upper Canada from 1791 to 1796. Named after his godfather, Captain Samuel Graves, John Graves Simcoe often distinguished himself from his father, also named John, by using his middle name of Graves. The third son of Captain John Simcoe, Royal Navy, and Katherine Stamford Simcoe, John Graves Simcoe was the first to survive to adulthood. His father was a decorated naval officer, commanding both the frigate Prince Edward and later HMS Pembroke. Captain John Simcoe died in 1759 during the siege of Quebec from pneumonia and was buried off the coast of Anticosti in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the death of his father, John Graves Simcoe and his family moved from near Chelsea to the city of Exeter in County Devon. During this time, Katherine Simcoe enrolled her son in the first of a series of educational institutions, which later included Eaton and Oxford. After completing his schooling, Simcoe enlisted in the British Army, being commissioned as an ensign in the 35th Regiment of Foot in April 1770. Eventually, Simcoe went with his regiment to the Americas in 1775, taking part in the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775. Shortly after Christmas in 1775, Simcoe purchased a captaincy of the grenadier company of the 40th Regiment of Foot, likely with the help of now Admiral Samuel Graves. Graves served with the 40th at Brandywine, where he was wounded in the fighting. During his recovery, General William Howe awarded command of the Queen&rsquo;s Rangers to Simcoe with the provincial rank of major. During the winter, the regiment returned to its full complement, while also adding a company of cavalry and a company of Highlanders to their number. This period also saw the regiment impose a greater deal of discipline, with Simcoe cautioning his men against the atrocities that would cause the local populace to resent their presence.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trained and with experience in warfare in the Americas, Simcoe was prepared for the type of light infantry fighting that defined the Rangers on campaign. In the spring of 1778, he commanded the Rangers in two significant victories over the Americans. On March 18, 1778, Simcoe and Charles Mawhood set a trap for American forces using a feigned retreat away from Quintin&rsquo;s Bridge in New Jersey, allowing British forces to surround and batter the Americans; only the timely arrival of militia with artillery prevented the American force from being annihilated. Simcoe mapped this battle, showing the movement of the Americans from their defensive works across the Delaware River, and tracing their later path of flight. <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vv521\">The Battle of Quinton&rsquo;s Bridge<\/a> later took its name from the key feature of the battle, and demonstrated both Simcoe&rsquo;s cunning, as well as his cartographical skills.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simcoe mapped another battle, just three days after the victory at Quintin&rsquo;s Bridge. After threats of violence against civilians on both sides, the siege of Salem, New Jersey, appeared to be at a standstill. However, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vv54k\">a map drawn by Simcoe<\/a> showed the approach of the Queen&rsquo;s Rangers on the opposite side of Alloway Creek and their general position surrounding the house. In the early hours of the morning of March 21, Simcoe and his company struck the American position, killing several inside, including Judge William Hancock and his brother. &nbsp;Although he had been assured that Judge Hancock no longer lived in the home, Simcoe&rsquo;s attack created a great deal of fuel for American propaganda presses. Simcoe criticized his troops for adding another civilian death to the growing list of those caught in the middle of the warring forces.<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vv564\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vv57d\/940,1165,5505,4326\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:629px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Simcoe regretted the death of Hancock, he continued to inflict atrocities during the war. In August 1778, the Queen&rsquo;s Rangers slaughtered a company of Stockbridge Indians loyal to the American cause in what would become known as the Stockbridge Indian Massacre. <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vv564\">Mapped by Simcoe<\/a>, the battle shows both an understanding of light infantry tactics and a ruthless plan in which the ambush turned to slaughter.<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end of Simcoe&rsquo;s military career was defined by both his personal bravery and powerlessness to reverse British losses. In early October 1781 while under the command of General Charles Cornwallis, Simcoe and his Rangers were encircled at Yorktown, where they were facing the triple threat of poor supply, limited cold weather clothing, and tightening Franco-American lines. Simcoe proposed a daring breakout attempt, in which he and his Rangers would ride mounted through enemy lines and try to escape into open territory. Later, he proposed utilizing abandoned boats built by Benedict Arnold to ferry some of the army from Virginia into Maryland. In both instances Cornwallis, despite his appreciation of Simcoe&rsquo;s initiative, declined, stating that the British would all share the same fate. After the surrender of British forces to George Washington on October 19, 1781, the British sent the sloop Bonetta north to New York City with the sick on board. Cornwallis permitted Simcoe to join the ship after advice from army surgeons, as he was ill from prolonged exposure to the elements with limited supply and clothing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 1781, after convalescing in New York, Simcoe returned to England with other officers. He continued his recovery in Devonshire with Admiral Samuel Graves and Graves&rsquo;s second wife, Margaret Spinckles Graves. During this time, Simcoe met Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim, whom he married in 1782.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the creation of Upper and Lower Canada in 1791, Simcoe was appointed as the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada in 1792. Simcoe was pivotal in the establishment of the capital of the new colony at Newark (today Niagara-on-the-Lake) and operated a competent administration from the city. During his tenure, Simcoe oversaw the passage of the Upper Canadian Act of 1793 Against Slavery, the first emancipatory legislation passed by the British Empire. In this act, no existing enslaved person in Upper Canada was freed but the further importation of enslaved individuals was banned, and all children born into slavery would be freed at age 25. In the early 1790s, when war looked likely between the United States and Great Britain again, Simcoe looked to move the capital of Upper Canada. Simcoe was granted approval to move the capital to York (today Toronto). Poor health plagued Simcoe for the rest of his career. As a result he resigned in 1796, when he was unable to return to Canada after a voyage back to England.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simcoe returned to army life later that same year, fighting briefly in Saint-Domingue (today Haiti) against Toussaint Louverture. He was replaced after less than a year in command of British forces on the island. Despite this setback, Simcoe was promoted to Lieutenant General, and later made Commander-in-Chief to British India, replacing his former commander Cornwallis in 1806, after his death in October 1805. However, Simcoe never formally assumed command before his own death in Exeter in January 1806. While controversial&nbsp;in some modern depictions of the period, Simcoe&#39;s career is typically remembered as one of a competent soldier, industrious statesman, and lifelong scholar. In Toronto, he is memorialized for his efforts against slavery and other achievements with John Graves Simcoe Day,&nbsp;which is celebrated the first Monday in August.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Elizabeth Posthuma Simcoe (nee Gwillim) was a British writer, artist, and wife of John Graves Simcoe (1752-1806), the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada (1791-1798). She is best known for her diary entries, watercolors, sketches, and maps of the frontier of Upper and Lower Canada from 1791 to 1796. Simcoe&rsquo;s various works provide a unique insight into her life as a female cartographer and artist as well as a British explorer of Canada in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simcoe was born in Aldwincle, Northamptonshire, England in 1762. Orphaned at birth, she inherited her family&rsquo;s fortune as the sole heir of her father Colonel Thomas Gwillim. She was adopted by her aunt and uncle, Margaret Spinckles and Admiral Samuel Graves, and eventually married John Graves Simcoe, Admiral Graves&rsquo; godson, with whom she had eleven children. As a young girl, Simcoe likely received instruction in various art forms through her formal education, typical of the period&rsquo;s standards for young women. By the time she reached young adulthood, she was especially talented in watercolor painting and sketching. John Simcoe was a cartographer by trade, and although it is not known who exactly taught her how to draw maps, Elizabeth was likely mentored by her husband in the practice.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simcoe&rsquo;s diaries have been extremely well preserved and contain not only various watercolors and sketches of Canadian scenery, coastlines, and maps, but also commentary and criticisms of other British surveyors&rsquo; work. She wrote in 1792 that their maps are &ldquo;little better than sketches, little of the country having been surveyed. The surveyors draw slowly, and, I am told, when they want to suit their maps to the paper, do not scruple cutting off a few miles of the river or adding to it.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> In most of her diary entries, Simcoe briefly described her daily activities, the people she met, and the weather. In addition to keeping a diary, Simcoe also filled multiple sketchbooks filled with topographical drawings, watercolors of Canadian waterways, and maps of creeks and harbors. She frequently sent her sketches to family and friends in England, keeping them updated on her travels and recalling her activities at Niagara Falls or in Quebec. Simcoe was greatly involved in her husband&rsquo;s career and her talent for cartography was found to be &ldquo;extremely useful,&rdquo; according to a letter written by Lord Dorchester while visiting the Simcoe family around 1805.<a href=\"#\">[2] <\/a>He stated, &ldquo;Mrs. Simcoe is&hellip; bashful and speaks little&hellip; and fulfills all the duties of the mother and wife with the most scrupulous exactness. The performance of the latter she carries so far as to act the part of a private secretary to her husband.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/quod.lib.umich.edu\/cgi\/i\/image\/image-idx?id=S-WCL1IC-X-5673%5DWCL005750\"><img alt=\"Map of the great lakes attributed to Elizabeth Simcoe\" src=\"\/content\/esimcoe-1.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:507px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most notable maps Simcoe ever created was her <em>Sketch Map of Upper Canada Showing the Routes Lt. Gov. Simcoe Took on Journeys between March 1793 and September 1795.<\/em>&nbsp;The map is scaled about twenty miles to an inch and features various established counties, waterways, and routes that Simcoe or her husband visited on their expedition of Upper Canada. Other information such as distances between major cities and proposed areas to build towns are noted. A selection of the art Simcoe created during her Canadian journeys was made into an album for King George III. Titled<em> Drawing Presented by Governor Simcoe to his Majesty done by Mrs. Simcoe<\/em>. <em>View of North Canada, and a Map<\/em>, the album contained thirty-two ink drawings on birch bark glued to paper, including an altered version of her 1793 <em>Sketch of Upper Canada<\/em> map. Some historians argue that this album of Simcoe&rsquo;s pieces was gifted to George III to advance her husband&rsquo;s career, emphasizing her central role in not only his success as a political figure but also in the reception of the Canadian frontier in London.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elizabeth and John Simcoe left Canada in 1796 to reunite with their children in England after five years apart. She continued to produce watercolor portraits of the Canadian frontier until her death in January 1850 at the age of 87.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Charles Blaskowitz was one of the British military&rsquo;s most accomplished surveyors during the American Revolutionary War. Prior to the Revolution, he worked with other talented British cartographers to help survey key areas of colonial Canada. When the Revolutionary War broke out, Blaskowitz worked on campaign maps for General William Howe and a siege plan for Newport, Rhode Island.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blaskowitz was born in the Kingdom of Prussia in 1743. The region of his birth was very likely Silesia, which rests in present-day Poland; as such, he has also been identified as Polish by birth. During his teenage years, Blaskowitz immigrated to London to receive training at the Drawing Room of the Tower of London, the British government&rsquo;s institution for mapmaking for the army. Around this time, Blaskowitz himself joined the British army. When he was eighteen, Blaskowitz travelled to the Americas to take part in the creation of the Murray Map. Working in coordination with fellow British military surveyor James Murray, Blaskowitz assisted in mapping the St. Lawrence Valley. Published in 1761, the map was the first of Blaskowitz&rsquo;s career. In 1765, Blaskowitz again worked with Murray on a map of Lake Champlain, which charted the demarcation line between New York and Quebec.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vw04k\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vw05v\/5826,1380,5305,6883\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:797px; margin:5px 20px; width:614px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best-known works of Blaskowitz&rsquo;s career were made in the period between 1775 and 1777. In 1776,<a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vw04k\"> he surveyed and created the two primary maps for General William Howe&rsquo;s campaign in New York<\/a>, marking the tremendous rise of the 33-year-old surveyor.&nbsp;Each of the maps took up almost an entire wall, showing the landscape in the intimate detail that the campaign required. The following year, Blaskowitz served in Rhode Island, where he created his most recognizable work. Published on September 1, 1777, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:js956j11m\"><em>The Plan for the Town of New Port Rhode Island<\/em><\/a> depicts the fortified town of Newport, which was a target of the British navy.&nbsp;The map shows the fortifications of the town as well as the locations of important buildings and key infrastructure. One of these buildings was the Touro Synagogue, then the oldest synagogue building in British North America and the oldest surviving synagogue in the United States today, where George Washington would famously visit years later as president.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war ended, Blaskowitz returned to Britain, where he died in Lambeth in 1823. In 1939, the Polish artist Arthur Szyk featured Blaskowitz in an art exhibition at the New York World&rsquo;s Fair titled, <em>Pictures from the Glorious Days of The Polish American Fraternity<\/em>. In the painting of Blaskowitz, he is seen working on his map of Newport.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>John Gerard De Brahm (also known as William De Brahm) was a German-born cartographer and military engineer. De Brahm achieved distinction in colonial Georgia and South Carolina for his expertly detailed maps, eventually rising through colonial ranks to become the surveyor general for the Southern District of North America between 1764 and 1775. His reputation was marred by several developments in his life, including his involvement in the emerging religious mysticism movement of the late eighteenth century. However, De Brahm&rsquo;s contributions to early American geographical studies eventually proved massively influential.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Brahm was born in Koblenz, Germany in 1717. In his youth, he excelled at languages, mathematics, history, and experimental sciences, which proved auspicious for his later pursuits in North America. Before immigrating to North America, he served in the army of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII, eventually resigning in 1748. After denouncing Roman Catholicism, De Brahm was expelled from Bavaria, the first but not last time he was ostracized for his religious views. In 1751, with the assistance of a German bishop, De Brahm managed to immigrate to Georgia with 156 other religious dissidents as part of a mission to settle the town of Ebenezer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vs34p\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vs35z\/239,5089,7753,4133\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:426px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon arrival, De Brahm quickly gained recognition for his mapping skills and was appointed Surveyor General of Lands for the royal colony of Georgia. De Brahm began to map the colony and in 1757 published his first work, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vs34p\"><em>A Map of South Carolina and a Part of Georgia<\/em><\/a>.&nbsp;De Brahm&rsquo;s first map was praised by readers and considered a landmark in British cartography for its meticulous depiction of the leading plantations of the day. <em>A Map of South Carolina<\/em> was also revolutionary due to De Brahm&rsquo;s reliance on a scientific survey rather than popular belief. Between its presentation of the foremost planters and the opportunities for British westward expansion, the map reflected British imperial confidence by the mid-eighteenth century.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Brahm soon rose to the position of surveyor general of the Southern District of North America. While in this role, he was assigned the laborious task of mapping the Florida coastline to illustrate the territory the British won in the Seven Years&#39; War. As part of this project, De Brahm conducted surveys from St. Augustine to as far north as the St. Mary&rsquo;s River. De Brahm also succeeded in mapping nearly all of East Florida between the St. Johns River and the Atlantic Ocean. Compared to the other maps of his day, De Brahm&rsquo;s was uniquely scientific, relying on astronomical observations and trigonometry to determine the placement of various areas.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1771, however, the colonial governor of Florida stripped De Brahm his position as surveyor general and charged the cartographer with neglecting his duties on questionable evidence. De Brahm was subsequently sent to London to answer these charges. While awaiting trial, he published his <em>Report of the General Survey in the Southern District of North America<\/em>. After a royal board reinstated his position in 1775, De Brahm returned to America to create a map of Charleston. Unfortunately, the Cherokee, the ship on which he was traveling on, was captured by the British navy. De Brahm became a political prisoner and lived in London after the war.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nf00s\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524nf012\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:799px; margin:5px 20px; width:648px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1791, De Brahm moved back to America and settled in Philadelphia, where he became involved in religious mysticism. He published three religious tracts: <em>Time an Apparition of Eternity<\/em> (1791), <em>Voice of the Everlasting Gospel<\/em> (1791), and <em>Apocalyptic Gnomon Points out Eternity&rsquo;s Divisibility Rated with Time Pointed at by Gnomons Sidereal<\/em> (1795)&mdash;the last of which outlined his prophecy regarding the end of humanity.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a>&nbsp;Many of De Brahm&rsquo;s writings regarding human history were grounded in his knowledge of astronomy and earth sciences. During this period, he also wrote President George Washington several letters that detailed his prophecies.<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a> Washington&rsquo;s attitude toward De Brahm&rsquo;s views remains unknown, as he never responded.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his later years, De Brahm also garnered controversy for his support of Native Americans and condemnation of British imperialism,&nbsp;both of which were central to his mystical beliefs. He argued that humanity should model itself after Native American culture, which he believed had largely escaped the influence of British tyranny. De Brahm also exhibited disenchantment with his previous career as a surveyor, whose sole purpose he perceived was to perpetuate British imperialism.<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1799, John Gerard De Brahm died in Philadelphia. For many decades after his death, his contributions remained largely unknown. He was remembered in South Carolina only for being &ldquo;much addicted to alchemy, and wearing a long beard.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[4]<\/a> Today, scholars can more fully appreciate the impact of De Brahm&rsquo;s cartographical innovations.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Simeon De Witt was a geographer who served as the Surveyor General for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War and afterwards held the same title for the State of New York for fifty years. He was part of a three-person commission resulting in the Commissioners Plan of 1811 that determined the gridiron street system of Manhattan. De Witt&rsquo;s survey work also helped to develop several of New York&rsquo;s other major cities, including Ithaca and Albany.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:p8418t802\/\"><img alt=\"Image of Simeon De Witt's 1783 map, &quot;The Winter-Cantonment of the American Army and it's Vicinity for 1783&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:p8418t81b\/229,250,7729,5490\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:568px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a>De Witt was born in 1756 in Ulster County, New York (now Orange County), to an affluent family of Dutch ancestry. He graduated from Queen&rsquo;s College (today Rutgers University) in 1776. After graduating, De Witt&rsquo;s uncle, Colonel James Clinton, trained and helped him obtain a surveyor position for the Continental Army. While stationed in New Jersey, De Witt drew what is considered <a href=\"https:\/\/americanhistory.si.edu\/documentsgallery\/exhibitions\/dewitt_1.html\">the oldest surviving Anglo-American star map<\/a>.[1] Mapping stars was a training exercise for many surveyors, and it developed into a passion for De Witt. Later in life, when he lived in Albany, he sent &ldquo;Observations on the Eclipse of 16 June 1806, at Albany&rdquo; to the American Philosophical Society, of which he was a member.[2] In December 1780, George Washington appointed DeWitt as Surveyor of the Army after the death of the previous Surveyor General, Colonel <a href=\"\/people\/robert-erskine\/\">Robert Erskine<\/a>. During the march to Yorktown in 1781, De Witt and his assistants surveyed the country along the army&#39;s route and were present during the siege and surrender.[3] In 1783, he also mapped the <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:p8418t802\/\">last cantonment of the American army<\/a> within and surrounding the townships of Newburgh and New Windsor, New York.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, DeWitt replaced General Philip Schuyler as Surveyor General for the State of New York and held the position for the rest of his life.[4] In De Witt&rsquo;s resignation letter to Washington, he asked for help with &ldquo;the publication of Maps from the Surveys we have made during the War,&rdquo; in hopes of creating a collective of accurate maps of the United States.[5] Washington supported this idea as &ldquo;exceedingly reasonable &amp; just,&rdquo; and commended De Witt to Thomas Jefferson as, &ldquo;a Modest, sensible, sober, and deserving young Man, Esteemed a very good Mathematician, and well worthy [sic] encouragement.&rdquo;[6] However, the project failed to secure congressional funding and never materialized. In 1796, unbeknownst to De Witt, Washington nominated him to the Senate as Surveyor-General to the United States, and the appointment was ratified. De Witt was flattered but declined. Instead, he chose to continue cartography projects for New York, including <a href=\"https:\/\/collections.leventhalmap.org\/search\/commonwealth:6t053q20w\">his map of the state<\/a> first published in 1802 and republished in 1804.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1807, the New York City Common Council appointed De Witt to a three-person commission to determine the layout of the city. By law, the commissioners had &ldquo;exclusive power to lay out streets, roads, and public squares, of such width, extent, and direction, as to them shall seem most conducive to public good.&rdquo;[7] De Witt never lived in Manhattan, preferring to complete as much of the work as possible from his home in Albany. The Commissioners Plan of 1811 took four years to create, ultimately determining that a gridiron layout was the most practical since &ldquo;straight-sided and right-angled houses are the most cheap to build and the most convenient to live in.&rdquo;[8]<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1810 to 1816, De Witt was a member of the first Erie Canal Commission, a project led by his cousin and Mayor of New York City, De Witt Clinton. De Witt ordered the making of surveys that would prove essential for the building of the canal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vg68n\/\"><img alt=\"Detail from &quot;1st. sheet of De Witt's state-map of New York,&quot; 1792.\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:6108vt35r\/700,106,2890,1726\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:299px; width:500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During De Witt&rsquo;s later years, he built a home in Ithaca and resided there until his death in 1834 at age 77.

            "description": "<p>Robert Erskine (1735-1780) was a Scottish-American businessman, inventor, and mapmaker during the late eighteenth century. While he contributed to technological advancements in engineering and hydraulics, Erskine is most famous for his role as the first Geographer and Surveyor of Roads for the Continental Army from 1777 to 1780. He and his team of surveyors supplied the army with approximately 275 maps, which were imperative to American victories throughout the Revolutionary War.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erskine was born on September 7, 1735, in Dunfermline, Scotland, to Margaret and Ralph Erskine, a Presbyterian minister. Robert attended the University of Edinburgh twice, once in 1748 and again in 1752. Although there are no records of his academic performance or completion of his studies, Robert moved to London in 1759 and found employment with a Mr. Swinton selling hardware and farm tools.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This arrangement lasted until 1760, when Swinton left with hopes of conducting business in the American colonies. He took a considerable amount of their product and Erskine never heard from him again, leaving Erskine to file for bankruptcy. Relying on his mechanical skills, Erskine invented the continual steam pump in the early 1760s to pay off his debts. By June 1762, he had no money and nearly twenty of his creditors filed a grievance. He was detained for a short period until the London debtors&rsquo; court freed him with the understanding that he would settle his accounts.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1764, Erskine followed that promise when William Cole, an instrument maker in London, sent his pump to the directors of the Salt Works of Westphalia to produce and manufacture the machine. Erskine continued to create new machines, including the platometer and the centrifugal hydraulic engine. His designs focused heavily on civic improvement, particularly as they related to rivers, which is reflected in his publication, <em>A Dissertation on Rivers and Tides<\/em> (1770). In 1769, after learning about Erskine&rsquo;s work in civic improvement projects, a representative from the London-based Hasenclever, Seton &amp; Crofts Syndicate in London approached Erskine with an exciting career opportunity. The group, also known as &ldquo;The American Iron Company,&rdquo; purchased four pig iron mines throughout New Jersey and New York and offered him the position of director. Erskine accepted the position and learned both the mechanical and technical elements of mines and furnaces as well as the process of converting iron into steel. By 1771, his work caught the attention of Benjamin Franklin and fellow members of the Royal Society of London, which awarded Erskine the title of &ldquo;A Gentleman well versed in Mathematics and Practical Mechanics.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erskine remained with the American Iron Company and shipped aboard the <em>Britannia <\/em>for New York, arriving on June 5, 1771. He spent the first year and a half in the American colonies as a mining inspector in the colony of New York. He reported the strengths, weaknesses, and possible improvements of mining sites to syndicates of the American Iron Company. In March 1773, Erskine was commissioned a justice of the peace in New Jersey. His correspondence with company syndicates reveals the political, economic, and environmental conditions of the colonies as they related to the mines. As the American Revolution became imminent, Erskine sided with the Americans. He understood that alliances and militias would be necessary to ensure the safety of the mines and their workers. This led him to organize one of the first companies of militia, which consisted of the men who worked for him. The New Jersey legislature officially commissioned him as a captain in August 1775.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This transition to military leadership gave Erskine another opportunity to use his mechanical skills. His next major invention was a tetrahedron-shaped marine <em>cheval de frise<\/em>, a defensive obstacle used to stop the passage of ships on rivers. Erskine&rsquo;s invention was used to obstruct the Hudson River. American officers, including General John Morin Scott, saw the promise of the invention and began to build a chain of <em>chevaux de frise <\/em>at Fort Washington, but the British managed to take over the respective land before its completion.<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erskine&rsquo;s cartography career began in the mid-1770s when General Charles Lee asked Erskine to sketch the New York and New Jersey countryside. Erskine&rsquo;s knowledge of the mining regions and his ability to detect land improvements aided in his work as a cartographer. While Erskine began sketching the New York countryside, General George Washington was in dire need of maps to make the best strategic and tactical decisions. Although Lee was captured at Basking Ridge soon after requesting the map, Erskine arrived at the Continental Army headquarters in March 1777 to present his work. Washington saw his map and asked for him to make another one of the New Jersey countryside, which officially began Erskine&rsquo;s work as a geographer for the Continental Army.<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon receiving Erskine&rsquo;s map of New Jersey, Washington wrote to Congress requesting an official geographer and surveyor of the roads. On July 25, 1777, Erskine officially assumed the post of Geographer and Surveyor-General. Erskine greatly expanded his department, adding a company of surveyors, including Simeon De Witt as his &ldquo;chief lieutenant&rdquo; in addition to nine others.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:p8418t86q\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:p8418t870\/144,96,5179,7329\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:802px; margin:5px 20px; width:567px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the next three years, Erskine&rsquo;s maps played an integral role in the war. His maps of areas like <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:p8418t86q\">White Plains, New York<\/a>, for instance, aided military navigation in 1779. Two of his maps of the Hudson Highlands, including the roads, rivers, mountains, fords, and marshes of the region, also informed operations by General Anthony Wayne and Major Henry Lee in the summer of 1779. After receiving the maps, Wayne led a successful nighttime attack on Stony Point and Lee attacked the British-held Paulus Hook, effectively pushing the British away from any control of the Hudson River. These victories might not have been possible without Erskine&rsquo;s maps. Additionally, his headquarters near the mine and furnace at Ringwood, New Jersey, became such an integral supply depot for the Continental Army that Washington sent guards to protect the area from British invasion.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1780, Erskine&rsquo;s surveyor department within the Continental Army had dwindled in size. With fewer surveyors on missions to sketch the countryside, Erskine was in the field more frequently. This led to his unfortunate and untimely sickness in the early fall. On September 18, 1780, Erskine died in his home, likely due to pneumonia, in the care of his nephew Ebenezer Erskine.<a href=\"#\">[4]<\/a> Following Erskine&rsquo;s death, Washington appointed Simeon De Witt to serve as the next Geographer and Surveyor-General. Although Erskine did not witness America&rsquo;s final victory, his efforts in creating nearly three hundred maps contributed greatly to military intelligence and strategy. Erskine&rsquo;s legacy also resonates in current military cartographic institutions. The U.S. Army Map Service&rsquo;s Erskine Hall houses numerous mapping functions for military operations such as photogrammetry, cartography, engineer intelligence, and geodetic libraries.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>George Gauld was a British surveyor and cartographer who produced notable maps of the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean in the mid-eighteenth century. Though of great quality and possessing an incredible degree of accuracy, Gauld&rsquo;s maps, much like the man himself, existed in relative obscurity on the margins of the British Empire until after his death in 1782.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in Scotland in 1732, Gauld entered the world in a time of Enlightenment and British expansion overseas. While little is known of Gauld&rsquo;s early years, he studied at Scotland&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s College, receiving high marks and displaying particular talent in mathematics, natural history, and philosophy. As a young man, Gauld became a naval schoolmaster aboard HMS Preston and toured the Mediterranean. Following his service as schoolmaster and discharge from the navy, Gauld labored to master cartography and pursued a respected and lucrative career as a surveyor-cartographer for the British Empire. Gauld&rsquo;s official career as a cartographer coincided with the end of the Seven Years&rsquo; War and the British acquisition of Florida from the Spanish in 1763. The following year, the Admiralty dispatched Gauld to chart the new British territory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In August 1764, Gauld arrived and took residence at the capital of West Florida, Pensacola, where he would spend much of the rest of his life. In the same year, Gauld would survey and produce a <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd05z\">detailed plan <\/a>for a harbor in his new residence of Pensacola.&nbsp;For the next seventeen years, he established himself as not only a masterful cartographer, but also as a staple of society and politics in Pensacola. Devoted to his cartography and possessing &ldquo;a strong sense of duty,&rdquo; according to his biographer John D. Ware, Gauld was neither a political partisan nor someone to abuse his position of power.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> In the eyes of his neighbors, Gauld was therefore the ideal politician to represent them. In 1769, he was selected to serve as a representative of the Pensacola delegation to the West Florida General Assembly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd05z\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524nd067\/full\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:616px; margin:5px 20px; width:790px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside his achievements in cartography and success in local politics, Gauld also proved to be financially savvy. Often being the first to judge and appraise the lands he surveyed, Gauld used his insider knowledge and his political connections to amass wealth. In May 1776, he successfully petitioned West Florida Governor Peter Chester for an additional two thousand acres of land, &ldquo;having resided chiefly in this province since its first establishment and being desirous of making a settlement on the east branch of the Peral River.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a> Having established an impressive reputation in the British colonies as a cartographer and politician, Gauld married in 1776. Although little is known about &nbsp;Ann Gauld beyond speculation that she was a widow of a military officer, the couple lived an active and social life, engaging in West Florida high society and entertaining a continuous stream of guests.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florida remained loyal to Britain when the American Revolutionary War broke out and initially escaped the violence to the north. However, the situation changed dramatically with the delayed entry of Spain into the war against the British in 1779. The war spilled into Florida as Spain recaptured and ultimately retook Florida in 1780, exiling those who had settled there during the two decades of British rule, including George and Ann Gauld. While war raged around him in colonial North America, Gauld continued his passion and talent of cartography, completing <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vv386\">a chart of the Pensacola bay harbor<\/a> in 1780.&nbsp;After a period of exile in New York, the Gaulds retired to London where they lived out the rest of their days. George Gauld died not long after on June 8, 1782 at the age of 50, but his legacy as a cartographer was just beginning.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gauld left Ann the small amount of their wealth they were able to recoup after the Spanish seized his holdings, as well as his obscure, uncirculated maps. To deal with her economic difficulties after her husband&rsquo;s death, Ann partnered with publishers John Lorimer and <a href=\"\/people\/william-faden\">William Faden<\/a> to produce and sell Gauld&rsquo;s maps. This partnership finally brought George&rsquo;s maps into wider circulation, granting him posthumous fame and recognition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gauld&rsquo;s maps played a role in the history of the United States after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and during the War of 1812. In October 1803, attorney and former member of the South Carolina legislature William Marshall sent President Thomas Jefferson Gauld&rsquo;s &ldquo;accurate Chart of the Coast of West Florida and Louisiana, including a survey and soundings of the Mississippi river, extending, considerably above New Orleans&rdquo; to aid the executive in navigating and understanding the newly acquired territory.<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a> Gauld&rsquo;s map made another resurgence during James Madison&rsquo;s presidency. In July 1812, Madison&rsquo;s friend and informal naval advisor, William Tatham, stressed to the president the need to produce &ldquo;similar documents of the British operations &amp; works in Florida&rdquo; to maps crafted by Gauld in order to combat the British in this theater of war, reinforcing Gauld&rsquo;s legacy long after his death.<a href=\"#\">[4]<\/a><\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Although best remembered as the father of Thomas Jefferson, Peter Jefferson was a distinguished man in his own right: a county justice, a burgess, a Virginia gentry elite, and a celebrated surveyor. &nbsp;He was famous for his contributions to the Fry-Jefferson Map of Virginia, the most important map of Virginia drawn in the eighteenth century. His intellect, social status, and surveying exploits would leave an indelible mark on his son Thomas and, thus, American history.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Jefferson was born February 29, 1708, the fourth of six children to Thomas Jefferson (1677-1731) and Mary Field Jefferson (1679-1715). Peter&rsquo;s mother died when he was only eight, a loss which likely contributed to what his son Thomas Jefferson later described as Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;quite neglected&rdquo; education. Still, possessing what Thomas called a &ldquo;strong mind, sound judgement and eager after information,&rdquo; Peter educated himself and improved his understanding of the world through books to the point where he could perform as well as, or better than, other members of the Virginia gentry. Jefferson took a particularly strong interest in mathematics.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>At age twenty-four, Jefferson&rsquo;s father died, and he became the beneficiary of properties on Manakin Creek and Fine Creek, where he built a house, dubbed &ldquo;Fine Creek Manor.&rdquo; Jefferson expanded his landholdings, acquiring a thousand acres by 1735. On October 3, 1739, Jefferson married Jane Randolph (1721-1776), with whom he had ten children, and the couple moved to the Piedmont region of Virginia to build an estate they called Shadwell. Jefferson was busy in these years, becoming a justice of the peace, a judge of the court of chancery, and a lieutenant colonel of the Albemarle militia, all while overseeing the business at Shadwell.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the overseer of the Shadwell estate and the owner of thousands of acres of land, Jefferson practiced the skills of surveying regularly, and his renown in the field grew. Among his earliest known projects, Jefferson worked on a map of the Rappahannock River in 1737 with the surveyor Robert Brooke, and nine years later he mapped the Northern Neck of Virginia with Brooke&rsquo;s son. Surveying offered Jefferson and the men of his era a profitable, well-respected career with powerful connections.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jefferson&rsquo;s most famous association was with Joshua Fry, the Albemarle County surveyor, with whom he is forever linked because of their groundbreaking work together. Jefferson and Fry worked together on various projects, including an expedition in 1746 to draw the Fairfax line between the claims of Virginia and Lord Fairfax&rsquo;s grant for the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers. The Fry-Jefferson duo continued in 1749 by mapping the Virginia-North Carolina dividing line. This expedition became legendary in the Jefferson family through stories of Jefferson&rsquo;s heroism and perseverance in the face of wild beasts and lack of food supplies. According to family legend, the expedition crew ate raw meat and slept in trees at night to survive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vr10w\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:z603vr115\/90,501,9046,5816\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:514px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1750, as tensions increased between Britain and France over territorial claims in the Ohio Country, the English Board of Trade ordered a more accurate map of Virginia. Lewis Burwell, the acting governor of Virginia, commissioned Jefferson and Fry to complete the map. The pair relied on their own surveys and manuscripts, as well as existing maps by Captain John Smith from 1612 and Augustine Herman from 1673. They finished their work in less than a year. Jefferson and Fry delivered the map to Governor Burwell in 1751 and forwarded it to London, where it was engraved. The final copy was published in the summer of 1753 under the title <em>A Map of the Inhabited Part of Virginia Containing the Province of Maryland, with Part of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and North Carolina<\/em>. The map underwent subtle changes in the succeeding years, becoming <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vr10w\"><em>A Map of the Most Inhabited Part of Virginia Containing the Whole Province of Maryland<\/em><\/a>, known colloquially as the Fry-Jefferson Map of Virginia. As the most complete map of Virginia at the time, it was critical for the British Empire in its territorial competition with the French in North America. The map accurately recorded for the first time the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Virginia Valley, the two forks of Shenandoah River, and the entire colony&rsquo;s road system. It also proved a valuable resource to later cartographers&mdash;including John Mitchell, who used it to help create the map of eastern North America used to determine the boundaries of the new United States for the Treaty of Paris in 1783.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>After completing his work on the Fry-Jefferson Map, Jefferson served in positions across all levels of Virginia gentry politics: as Goochland County surveyor, again as justice of the peace in Albemarle, as county surveyor, as a member in the House of Burgesses, and in Fry&rsquo;s position as county lieutenant following his death in 1754.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jefferson also continued his duties at Shadwell, now a successful tobacco plantation maintained by over sixty enslaved workers. During the summer of 1757, Jefferson fell ill, and he died on August 17. He passed with his name attached to the most significant map of Britain&rsquo;s largest North American colony and left his wife, six daughters, and two sons the largest estate in the colony. His son Thomas eventually built Monticello atop acreage once owned by his father.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Henry Pelham (1748\/49-1806) was an artist, engraver, and cartographer who contributed to the British war effort during the American Revolution.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little is known about Pelham&rsquo;s early life. He was born in Boston to Peter Pelham, and Mary Singleton Copley Pelham, who married Pelham after the death of her first husband, Richard Copley. Pelham attended Boston Latin School, where he likely studied the arts, alongside his half-brother, John Singleton Copley, and began his practice of miniature paintings. In 1765, Copley rose to fame after sending a portrait of Pelham titled, <em>Boy with Squirrel<\/em>, for exhibition in London.<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> Copley then moved to London and trained under famed artist Benjamin West.<a href=\"#ref2\">[2]<\/a> While there, Copley would continue to write to his brother in Boston, providing artistic training and advice, while Pelham shared information on affairs at home.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 1770, Pelham created an engraving of the events that would become known as the Boston Massacre. He titled the engraving <em>The Fruits of Arbitrary Power, Or Bloody Massacre<\/em>. Pelham lent a copy of his work to Paul Revere, who copied it almost exactly and sent it to the printing press a week before Pelham could send his. Pelham was unhappy with Revere&rsquo;s actions and wrote a letter to him on March 29, 1770, attacking his honor and integrity by equating Revere&rsquo;s behavior to highway robbery.<a href=\"#ref3\">[3]<\/a> Revere failed to credit Pelham&rsquo;s work, which has mostly faded into obscurity, with very few print copies surviving today.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an ardent loyalist, Pelham often complained in his letters about the &ldquo;turbulant [sic] and factious town&rdquo; of Boston, and how the people were deluded with the hope for revolution.<a href=\"#ref4\">[4]<\/a> While traveling to Philadelphia in the winter of 1775, a mob attacked Pelham and his companions in Springfield, Massachusetts, calling them &ldquo;a damn&rsquo;d pack of Torys.&rdquo;<a href=\"#ref5\">[5]<\/a> This attack only fueled his frustrations with the patriot cause.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:3f462w840\/\"><img alt=\"Image of Henry Pelham's &quot;A Plan of Boston in New England,&quot; 1777\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:3f462w858\/272,165,6361,9451\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:835px; margin:5px 20px; width:562px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775 disrupted Boston&rsquo;s economy, leaving Pelham unable to collect money or conduct his portraiture business. With ample free time, he began to survey Charlestown with the permission of Generals Thomas Gage and William Howe.<a href=\"#ref6\">[6]<\/a> Pelham&rsquo;s <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:3f462w840\">resulting map<\/a> included the environs of Boston and the state of military affairs in its surrounding towns: Milton, Dorchester, Roxbury, Brookline, Cambridge, Medford, Malden, Charlestown, and Chelsea. The map is considered one of the most important battle plans of Boston because it shows, in great detail, fortifications and locations of British and American troops. On the top left corner of the map, Pelham included a facsimile of a pass issued by James Urquhart, the British-appointed town-major who oversaw the occupied city, which allowed Pelham to survey rebel-held land without obstruction. Pelham included the pass to prove the accuracy of his work. The fine details in the map reflect Pelham&rsquo;s artistic abilities in miniatures. General Howe asked Pelham to delay publishing the map for fear that its information could benefit the enemy.<a href=\"#ref7\">[7]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A year went by with little to no business in Boston, and Pelham realized that the letters he sent and received were no longer secure because opening incoming mail was &nbsp;&ldquo;a liberty now very frequently taken.&rdquo;<a href=\"#ref8\">[8]<\/a> Pelham asked his brother John to stop writing about politics of any sort to protect his own wellbeing. By August 1776, with his future in America uncertain, Pelham decided to join John in England and likely brought his map of Charlestown with him. In hopes of securing a more stable future in England, he dedicated the map to Secretary of War Lord George Germain. After its publication in 1777, Pelham received commissions for portraits and miniatures in London and eventually started a landscape and cartography business. After some time in England, Pelham moved to Ireland in the late 1770s and married an Irish woman named Catherine Butler, who died while giving birth to twin sons. Building upon his surveying skills from Boston, Pelham was commissioned to survey County Clare and County Kerry in Ireland.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1804, the Royal Dublin Society appointed Pelham as Assistant Engineer for the emergency fortification of Bere Island off the coast of southern Ireland, where he undertook the production of a large-scale military map of the island. After finishing the map, Pelham remained on the island, and scholars speculate that he died from a drowning incident in 1806 at the age of 57. His map of Boston continues to benefit scholars as one of the most detailed maps to survive from the American revolutionary era.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Marie Catherine and Elizabeth Haussard were French engravers known for their beautiful engravings on geographical maps and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalcommonwealth.org\/search\/commonwealth:0p097h38v\">natural history<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digitalcommonwealth.org\/search\/commonwealth:0p097g40p\">plates<\/a>. Little is known about the lives of the sisters, and much of their work has been lost or misattributed due to the difficulty of publishing as a woman in the eighteenth century. There are still many beautiful cartouches, however, that can be definitively accredited to the Haussard sisters. They worked on a variety of maps, many of which were included in the famous French <em>Atlas Universel <\/em>(1757). From their home in Paris along the Rue du Platre, Marie Catherine and Elizabeth produced engravings that graced map cartouches for North America, South America, Egypt, Belgium, and Lorraine.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little is known about Marie Catherine and Elizabeth Haussard&rsquo;s childhoods. Based on contextual evidence, including the birth dates of their contemporaries, the two sisters were born approximately at the turn of the eighteenth century. Marie Catherine and Elizabeth were the daughters of notable Parisian engraver Jean-Baptiste Haussard (1679-1749). Jean-Baptiste was best known for his works in the <em>Recueil Ferriol<\/em> (1714), a collection of illustrations created as part of the European effort to distinguish ethnic groups in the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the eighteenth century. He was responsible for executing fifteen total engravings in the <em>Recueil Ferriol<\/em>, including famous works such as <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/510d47d9-69f9-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><em>Turkish Girl at the Bath<\/em><\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalcollections.nypl.org\/items\/510d47d9-6a1f-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99\"><em>Armenian Girl Going to be Married<\/em><\/a>. Marie Catherine and Elizabeth learned engraving from their father before producing their own works, including map legends, labels, and decorative map cartouches. The sisters also engraved natural history plates and scientific works.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cartography exploded in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Women were heavily involved in mapmaking, although most only learned through indirect means, such as from their husbands or fathers. The Haussard sisters, like many other women in the field, including Mary Ann Rocque, used their initials instead of their names to sign their works. While doing so allowed them to conceal their gender, this same tactic makes it difficult to recognize their works today. Notably, there is evidence that both sisters, while doing contract work for the Comite de Librairie of the Academie Royale des Sciences, petitioned for greater compensation for their work: &ldquo;We have engraved the plates for the volumes of the <em>Savants Etrangers<\/em> for many years, but that is becoming more and more difficult.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Haussard sisters are best known for their work for the de Vaugondy family of cartographers. Marie Catherine and Elizabeth signed nearly one third of the cartouches in the famous <em>Atlas Universel<\/em>, a collection of 108 maps by Gilles and Didier Robert de Vaugondy and the first atlas sold in France by subscription. With estimates of subscribers ranging from six hundred to one thousand, the Atlas was one of the most acclaimed works of its time, supporting Vaugondy&rsquo;s appointment as Geographe Ordinaire du Roi. Among the subscribers was Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, Marquise de Pompadour, indicating its patronage by the royal court.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:w9505s84p\"><img alt=\"Detail from Gilles Robert de Vaugondy's 1755 map Partie de l'Amerique septent showing the cartouche engraved by Marie Catherine Haussard\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:w9505s85z\/5568,3461,2502,2392\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:765px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few of the maps in the Atlas engraved by the Haussard sisters stand out. In the <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:w9505s84p\"><em>Partie de l&#39;Am&eacute;rique Septent.&nbsp;Qui Comprend la Nouvelle France ou le Canada<\/em><\/a> (Part of North America&nbsp;Which Includes New France and Canada),&nbsp;Marie Catherine&rsquo;s signature, &ldquo;C. Haussard,&rdquo; is discernible in the detail of the map. The striking cartouche includes popular symbols of the North American wilderness and voyageur lifestyle in the Great Lakes region of New France: pine trees, a beaver, and a canoe. Another of Marie Catherine&rsquo;s works in the Atlas is the <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vh01g\"><em>Partie de l&#39;Am&eacute;rique Septentrionale Qui Comprend le Cours de l&#39;Ohio, la Nlle Angleterre, la Nlle York, le New Jersey, la Pensylvanie, le Maryland, la Virginie, la Caroline<\/em><\/a> (Part of North America Which Comprises of the Ohio River, New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Carolina). She is identified by the line &ldquo;M.C. Haussard,&rdquo; although she likely etched the detail into the design rather than incised it. The map covers the area from the Great Lakes to South Carolina and from the Atlantic Coast to the Mississippi River, whilst depicting provinces, counties, settlements, rivers, Native American territories, and forts. Elizabeth Haussard, the younger of the two sisters, also has notable works in the Atlas attributed to her. The <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:6t053p074\"><em>Carte de la Virginie et du Maryland<\/em><\/a> (Map of Virginia and Maryland), a French edition of the the <a href=\"\/people\/peter-jefferson\">Fry-Jefferson Map<\/a>, was issued in the <em>Atlas Universel <\/em>although two versions, or states, of the map exist. The first is dated to 1755 and the plate is signed &ldquo;E Haussard,&rdquo; presumably indicating the original was engraved by Elizabeth. The name E. Haussard was deleted in a later state of the Fry-Jefferson Map and from 1778 onward was replaced by the name &ldquo;Groux,&rdquo; probably engraver Charles Jacques Groux, although the confirmed identity of &ldquo;Groux&rdquo; and why he signed the cartouches is a mystery. The only previous map of Virginia associated with a woman was the Farrer map of 1651.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sisters&rsquo; dates of death are unknown. In fact, many important details about the lives of the sisters escape us today due to their strategic use of initials rather than full signatures on their work. Despite these obfuscations, however, they remain an important part of the cartographic institution of the eighteenth century.<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Pierre (Peter) Charles L&rsquo;Enfant (1754-1825) was an American Revolutionary War veteran and Franco-American engineer. L&rsquo;Enfant designed and constructed buildings during and after the Revolutionary War; however, he is best known for his design of the Federal City, which became Washington, D.C. His plan had no equivalent in the new United States, incorporating elements of European cities and a layout that placed the Capitol Building at the heart of the metropolis. Unfortunately, L&rsquo;Enfant clashed with other officials, leading to his resignation before construction of the Federal City had hardly begun. He died in poverty, and his vision for the federal district did not come to fruition until the McMillan Commission--a group of architects and planners appointed by the U.S. Senate&ndash;salvaged his plan at the turn of the twentieth century. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&rsquo;Enfant was born in Paris on August 2, 1754 to an aristocratic family in the French Court. His father was an artist, under whom L&rsquo;Enfant studied at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. He initially focused on architecture and drawing but felt unfulfilled in these pursuits. As his schooling concluded, an American secret agent in Paris offered L&rsquo;Enfant a lieutenancy in the Continental Army Corps of Engineers, which L&rsquo;Enfant accepted. This opportunity allowed him to use the skills he acquired at the Royal Academy, and L&rsquo;Enfant arrived in America in 1777, taking the name &ldquo;Peter.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&rsquo;Enfant would not remain a lieutenant for long. He was expeditiously promoted by Congress to be the captain of the Continental Army Corps of Engineers due to a recommendation from Friedrich von Steuben, a fellow foreign officer. The promotion helped L&rsquo;Enfant to become a force in the engineering world and develop his signature design style, which included motifs of patriotism and freedom. Such motifs were evident in L&rsquo;Enfant&rsquo;s construction of the celebration hall for the birth of the French King Louis XVII in April 1782 and in the insignia and diploma for the Society of Cincinnati, which was founded in 1783.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the Revolutionary War, L&#39;Enfant lived in New York City. &nbsp;He worked on a variety of projects, including Federal Hall, which was intended to be the place of government for the new nation. After the capital moved first to Philadelphia and then to the new federal district, Federal Hall was demolished in 1812.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nk63w\"><img alt=\"Image of Pierre Charles L'Enfant's 1791 Dotted Line Map of Washington D.C.\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524nk645\/177,146,12282,7849\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:511px; margin:5px 20px; width:800px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before the Residence Act of 1790 made the banks of the Potomac River the future location for the seat of government, L&rsquo;Enfant lobbied President George Washington for a role in the building process: &ldquo;The late determination of Congress to lay the Fundation of a City which is to become the Capital of this vast Empire, offer so great an occasion of acquiring reputation&hellip;, that your Excellency will not be surprised that my Embition and the desire I have of becoming a usefull Citizen should lead me to wish a share in the Undertaking.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[1]<\/a> In 1791, L&rsquo;Enfant&rsquo;s aspirations were fulfilled as Washington appointed him as the lead planner of the new federal district. Under the supervision of the Federal Commissioners of the District, a group of three supervisory commissioners, L&rsquo;Enfant worked quickly to complete his<em> <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nf90z\">Plan for the Seat of Government<\/a><\/em>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&rsquo;Enfant had a grand vision for the Federal City. His design integrated republican symbolism with his knowledge of European urban plans, such as for Paris, which incorporated accessible green spaces. He also admired the Palace of Versailles Gardens because of his upbringing close to the French Court. Hence, L&rsquo;Enfant designed the garden-lined Grand Avenue (National Mall) and included many other green spaces in his plan. As for the republican symbolism, he wanted to ensure that the city represented the political ideals of his adopted country. Most notably, he placed the Capitol Building on a grand hill and branched all avenues and streets from this central position.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In February of 1792, L&rsquo;Enfant wrote to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson detailing his vision of the Federal City. L&rsquo;Enfant stated that he wanted &ldquo;to change a Wilderness into a City, to erect and beautify Buildings &amp; ca. to that degree of perfection, necessary to receive the Seat of Government of so extensive an Empire.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[2]<\/a> This letter reflected L&rsquo;Enfant&rsquo;s ambition to create a capital worthy of America&rsquo;s present and future growth.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the same month that he wrote to Jefferson, L&rsquo;Enfant irritated the Federal Commissioners of the District by refusing to share his plan and for starting construction by demolishing the home of one of the commissioners. The commissioners threatened Washington with their potential resignations if L&rsquo;Enfant did not accept their input. Washington attempted to reprimand L&rsquo;Enfant with a letter sent through Thomas Jefferson, but L&rsquo;Enfant instead resigned in February 1792. Washington was fond of L&rsquo;Enfant and did not want him to leave, writing, &ldquo;The continuance of your services (as I have often assured you) would have been pleasing to me.&rdquo;<a href=\"#\">[3]<\/a> However, L&rsquo;Enfant never returned to the project, nor did he receive compensation for designing the capital.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>L&rsquo;Enfant continued building projects after his exit from the government. He designed forts for the War of 1812 and completed the layouts of Paterson, New Jersey, and Morris Mansion in Philadelphia. Yet financial troubles still troubled L&rsquo;Enfant for the rest of his life. Despite his illustrious career, he died impoverished in 1825 with an estate appraised at forty-five dollars. L&rsquo;Enfant was buried in an unmarked grave in the slave portion of the family graveyard at Green Hill Farm in Maryland. His distant child (whose mother is unknown) survived him.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the twentieth century, L&rsquo;Enfant finally received the recognition that eluded him during his lifetime. In 1901, for the centennial anniversary of Washington, D.C., the McMillan Commission formed and released a plan that restored much of L&rsquo;Enfant&rsquo;s original vision. In 1961, a major plaza (L&rsquo;Enfant Plaza) was also dedicated to him in Washington, D.C., the capital city born of his imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>",

            "description": "<p>Michel Capitaine Du Chesnoy was a French military officer and geographical engineer who served as aide-de-camp to General Marquis de Lafayette during his service in the American Revolutionary War. As part of his duties, Capitaine created a series of manuscript maps of strategically important sites related to Lafayette&rsquo;s battles. His maps include some of the most exact battlefield details of the war.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June 1777, at the age of 31, Capitaine arrived in South Carolina with the nineteen-year-old Marquis de Lafayette. The cartographer was soon struck by illness and would spend time recuperating for almost a year until the spring of 1778. During his time recovering, Capitaine produced one of his first and most consequential maps of the Revolutionary War: a survey of the British positions at Ticonderoga, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd555\"><em>Plan of Carillon or Ticonderoga<\/em><\/a>. <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd555\"><img alt=\"detail from Captiaine du Chesnoy's 1777 map &quot;Plan of Carillon ou [sic] Ticonderoga&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524nk513\/77,4128,2990,2000\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:334px; margin:5px 20px; width:500px\" \/><\/a>The map is unique, as Capitaine created the battlefield map through a combination of reconnaissance accounts and secondary maps without visiting the area. When the British occupied Fort Ticonderoga in October 1777, Lafayette was in Pennsylvania and Capitaine was in North Carolina. Unlike many of Capitaine&rsquo;s maps, the map&rsquo;s legend is largely in English, as the English-speaking Americans fighting at Saratoga were its primary audience.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In April 1778, Capitaine traveled north towards the main theater of war. Congress appointed him a captain in the Continental Corps of Engineers and assigned him to map the Susquehanna River. Lafayette was frustrated that his personal cartographer was not by his side for months as Capitaine was an invaluable part of the general&rsquo;s camp. Lafayette wrote to Henry Laurens, president of the Continental Congress, about Capitaine&rsquo;s assignment to chart the Susquehanna River, stating that he was &ldquo;glad he is employed if no other can do the business&rdquo; but that Capitaine should &ldquo;be considered as mine.&rdquo;<a href=\"#ref1\">[1]<\/a> By May 1778, Capitaine rejoined Lafayette&rsquo;s camp at Barren Hill near Philadelphia, where Lafayette was confronted with a massive number of British troops from the city who attempted to capture the hill. Capitaine depicted Lafayette&rsquo;s masterful retreat in<a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd53m\"> <em>Plan de la Retraite de Barren Hill en Pensilvanie<\/em><\/a>. The map portrays the positions of American, British, and Hessian soldiers as the British started their assault on the hill, and highlights important battlefield details such as roads, terrain, and troop deployments.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.argomaps.org\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd53m\/\"><img alt=\"Detail from Michel Capitaine du Chesnoy's 1778 map &quot;Plan de la retraite de Barren Hill en Pensilvanie&quot;\" src=\"https:\/\/iiif.digitalcommonwealth.org\/iiif\/2\/commonwealth:q524nd54w\/2213,1265,850,972\/full\/0\/default.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:572px; margin:5px 20px; width:500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the remainder of his service in the Revolutionary War, Capitaine traveled freely alongside Lafayette. He mapped the Battle of Monmouth in <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nd601\"><em>Carte de l&#39;Affaire de Montmouth le 28 Juin 1778 entre Clinton et Washington<\/em><\/a>. Capitaine carefully drew the terrain of deep ravines that would prove decisive in waging the battle along the several positions taken by the British and American armies. The twenty-four-item legend gives additional detailed notes on the action of the day. Capitaine received praise after sending the Monmouth and other maps to George Washington, who described them as &ldquo;executed with great accuracy and military intelligence&mdash;and will have a place among the papers on which I set a value.&rdquo; <a href=\"#ref2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 1779, Capitaine followed Lafayette to France, and played a pivotal role in representing the American revolutionary struggle to the French Court. As Lafayette said of Capitaine, &ldquo;Such an officer I can&rsquo;t spare, and I will employ him to make plans of our positions and battle for Washington, for me, and also for the king who will be glad to have an exact draft of Washington&rsquo;s battles.&rdquo;<a href=\"#ref3\">[3]<\/a> Capitaine brought his map, <em><a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:z603vt68q\">Carte du The\u0301atre de la Guerre dans l&#39;Ame\u0301rique Septentrionale, Pendant les Anne\u0301es 1775, 76, 77, et 78<\/a><\/em>, which was uncharacteristic of his work in depicting a large strategic overview of the Revolutionary War. The purpose was to provide King Louis XVI a picture of the broader continental struggle, and it succeeded in helping to reinforce France&rsquo;s support for the United States.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the spring of 1780, Capitaine returned to North America with Lafayette and mapped the general&rsquo;s final battles in the Revolutionary War. Capitane&rsquo;s last map of the war, <a href=\"\/maps\/commonwealth:q524nk52c\"><em>Plan d&#39;Une Partie de la Virginia<\/em><\/a>, provides an ambitious picture of both the strategy and tactics of the Virginia campaign of 1781.&nbsp;The map documents elements that were critical to the outcome of the Battle of Yorktown, including troop disposition and movement, terrain and locations of camps and batteries.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the battle, Capitaine again returned to France with Lafayette. Although the cartographer never returned to America, he retained his Continental Army rank of major until November 1783 and remained a lifetime member of the Society of the Cincinnati. Capitaine served as an assistant on the French army general staff until 1790.He died in France in 1804.<\/p>",
