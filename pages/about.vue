	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p>ARGO: American Revolutionary Geographies Online is an exciting new project led by Fred W. Smith Library National Library at George Washingtonâ€™s Mount Vernon and the Leventhal Map and Education Center at the Boston Public Library. Leveraging new technology and the recent drive by many museums, libraries, and archives to digitize their collections, the portal will collate digitized maps of North America made between 1750 and 1800 into a single user-friendly portal. In addition to providing users from many backgrounds with easy, intuitive access to beautiful high-resolution images, ARGO will also give people the tools they need to learn and understand through interpretive essays, curated collections, classroom materials, and more. As a platform for scholarship, education, and exploration, the goal of ARGO is to make the rich visual legacy of our Revolutionary past accessible to the public as never before. </p>
