	<h4>The Boston Public Library Map Collection</h4>

	<p><em>In the collection now:&nbsp;</em></p>

	<h4>The American Antiquarian Society</h4>

	<p>Founded in 1812 by Revolutionary War patriot and printer Isaiah Thomas, the American Antiquarian Society is both a learned society and a major independent research library. The AAS library today houses the largest and most accessible collection of books, pamphlets, broadsides, newspapers, periodicals, music, and graphic arts material printed through 1876 in what is now the United States, as well as manuscripts and a substantial collection of secondary texts, bibliographies, and digital resources and reference works related to all aspects of American history and culture before the twentieth century.<br />
	<br />
	Of the approximately 10,000 maps in the AAS collection, 560 are dated 1750-1800, from which we selected approximately 140 items.&nbsp;Most of these are printed maps of eastern North America and the West Indies not duplicated in the Leventhal Map Center collection, as well as a smaller number of manuscript maps of local Massachusetts interest, all dated during the last half of the 18th&nbsp;century.<br />

	<h4>Boston Athenaeum&nbsp;</h4>

	<p>Founded in 1807, the Boston Athen&aelig;um is one of the oldest and most distinguished independent libraries and cultural institutions&nbsp;in the United States. In creating the Boston Athen&aelig;um, their purpose was to form &quot;an establishment similar to that of the Athen&aelig;um and Lyceum of Liverpool in Great Britain; combining the advantages of a public library [and] containing the great works of learning and science in all languages.&quot; The new Athen&aelig;um flourished in culture-starved Boston and, as it voraciously acquired books, art, and artifacts, it grew rapidly. For nearly half a century the Athen&aelig;um was the unchallenged center of intellectual life in Boston, and by 1851, had become one of the largest libraries in the United States. Today its collections comprise over half a million volumes, with particular strengths in Boston history, New England state and local history, biography, English and American literature, and the fine and decorative arts.<br />
	<br />
	The Boston Athen&aelig;um&rsquo;s cartographic collection includes 3,000 maps and 600 atlases, but at the time of establishing this partnership only a small number had been digitized. Our selection of digital images includes two manuscript maps and 14 printed maps dating from 1750 to the first decade of the 19th&nbsp;century. These maps are not duplicated in the Leventhal Map Center&rsquo;s collection.</p>

	<h4>The British Library</h4>

	<p>The British Museum&#39;s Department of Printed Books was founded in 1753, the year of the foundation of the Museum itself. Over the intervening two hundred years, the library of the British Museum had grown into one of the largest in the world, sustained by its privilege of legal deposit whereby it was entitled to a copy of most items printed in the United Kingdom - not only books and periodicals, but newspapers, maps and printed music. The British Library was established in 1972 as a national center for reference, study and bibliographical and other information services, in relation both to scientific and technological matters and to the humanities.<br />
	<br />
	The British Library has one of the largest collections of maps, plans and topographical views in the world, numbering some 4.5 million, with a chronological spread of over 2,000 years. Our selection of approximately 350 digital images consists mainly of manuscript maps related to eastern North America and the West Indies during the American Revolutionary War era.&nbsp; These maps were selected primarily from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/king-george-iii">King George III Topographical Collection</a>, but were supplemented from other <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-guides/manuscript-map-collections">18th&nbsp;century&nbsp;collections of manuscript maps</a>&nbsp;held by the British Library.<br />

	<h4>Harvard Map Collection</h4>

	<p>The Harvard Map Collection, founded in 1818, is the oldest map collection in the United States. It houses one of the largest collections of maps, atlases and digital data in North America. The collection has grown to include ca. 400,000 maps, more than 6,000 atlases, and several thousand reference books. Topographic maps, city plans, nautical charts, and thematic maps comprise this excellent research collection representing all chronological periods and significant map makers. The Map Collection also has a strong commitment to digital resources and manages the collections of the&nbsp;Harvard Geospatial Library.<br />
	<br />
	While the Harvard Map Collection holds approximately 2,000 maps&nbsp; dating from the 1750-1800 time period, only a small number of maps (61) pertaining to the American Revolution have been digitized. From these digital files, we have selected approximately 30 printed maps related to the Revolutionary War, dated from 1775-1795. These maps are not duplicated in the collections of the Leventhal Map Center.<br />

	<h4>Sidney R. Knafel Map Collection at Philips Andover Academy</h4>

	<p>The Sidney R. Knafel Map Collection is history itself in the form of a unique collection of atlases, maps, and globes dating from 1434 well into the 19th century. Many of these rare objects and documents are the subject of a 1992 book,&nbsp;<em>Shedding the Veil: Mapping the European Discovery of America and the World</em>&nbsp;by Thomas Su&aacute;rez, and comprised in that year as an exhibit at the Addison Gallery on the campus of Phillips Academy in Andover Massachusetts, to mark the 500th anniversary of Columbus&#39; landing in the New World.<br />
	<br />
	The collection was given to Phillips Academy in December 2011 by Sidney Knafel, class of 1948, in honor of the 18-year tenure leadership of Barbara Chase as she stepped away from the Headship and he from his role as Charter member of the Board of Trustees. Mr. Knafel collected the items as a personal passion inspired by looking out over the Atlantic from Martha&#39;s Vineyard and imagining how this land must have struck those Europeans who arrived half a millennium ago.<br />
	<br />
	At Mr. Knafel&#39;s request, the collection will be on continual display within the teaching spaces of the Academy to be used as classroom tools for students. Digitization affords opportunities for teachers and students to work freely with the collection at the highest resolution so that images of globes, atlases, and renderings of coastal New England and New France at various stages of exploration and incorporation by Europeans can be examined closely.&nbsp; This selection of digital images consists of almost 90 items, including 50 maps of the world, the Western Hemisphere, and New England that are dated before 1750, and an additional 20 that are relevant to the American Revolutionary War era.<br />
